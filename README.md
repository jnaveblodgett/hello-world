# hello-world
learning this whole git thing
====
what is code like in github? what are edits like? what are comments like? what's the spacing rules?
    I assume it's the four spaces rather than tabs thing. I should probably go read the python documentation about how to be a good coder or something like that. 

I'm here to chew bubblegum and code python, and I'm all out of... pythons? I have a lot of gum. It doesn't make good bubbles, though.

Seriously, though. I'm here to learn how to program so that I can more efficiently program experiments and process my data.
